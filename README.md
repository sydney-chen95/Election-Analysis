# Election-Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given us a task to run an analysis for a recent election. Our source will come from an election_results.csv file and with Visual Studio Code, we will perform this following:

1. Calculate the total number of vote cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
-Data Source: election_results.csv

-Software: python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Results
The analysis of the election show that:
-There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
-The candidates were:
    -Charles Casper Stockham
    -Diana DeGette
    -Raymon Anthony Doane
-The candidate results were:
    -Charles Casper Stockham recevied 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes.
    -Diana DeGette recevied 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.
    -Raymon Anthony Doane recevied 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes.
-The winner of the election was:
    -Diana DeGette, who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.
    
## Challenge Overview
The Board of Elections employee has requested additional information to complete the audit. We will perform the followin tasks:

1. Calculate the voter turnout for each county.
2. Calculate the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count.
3. Determine the county with the highest turnout.

## Challenge Results
Our new analysis shows that:
-There were three counties and it is:
    -Jefferson
    -Denver
    -Arapahoe
-The county results were:
    -Jefferson county received 10.5% of the vote and 38,855 number of votes.
    -Denver county received 82.8% of the vote and 306,055 number of votes.
    -Arapahoe county received 6.7% of the vote and 24,801 number of votes.
-The county with the highest turnout was:
    -Denver county, with 82.8% of the vote and 306,055 number of votes.
    
## Election-Audit Summary
This script is useful for any election. One way to modify this script is by inputting the election results file of your choice. Now that we have inputted a new election results file to analyze, we can run the code and output the new results in another text file. Another way to change this script is by using certain parts of the code to get specific results. For example, if we only want to know about the candidates of an election and not the respective county, then we can just run the block that loops through each row for candidate vote count.
